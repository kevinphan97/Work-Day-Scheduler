This is a simple web calendar application where a person can add items or events and it will be saved through local storage.

At the top of the page, the current date and time is located.
This web application shows work day hours on the left (08AM - 05PM).
The text boxes can contain any information placed into it.
The text boxes are also coded so that it will change colors depending if the time block is before, during or after the current time.
The save buttons on the right hand side of each text box is used to save the entries into the local storage.
The local storage is saved and when the page is refreshed the information is still saved onto the page.
